Hi, I'm Tom.

I'm a software engineer based in Edinburgh, Scotland. Currently working for the fantastic folks at [Appointedd](https://www.appointedd.com) doing full-stack development.

When I'm not doing that, I'm a dad with a wonderful wee girl, bouncy black labrador, and I enjoy dabbling in cybersecurity challenges and playing PC games.
